Strategic Market Analysis Report
Product: GREEN TEA (NOT FERMENTED) IN IMMEDIATE PACKINGS OF A CONTENT NOT EXCEEDING 3KG
Brand: “tea”
Enterprise Size: Medium Enterprise
Total Available Budget: 40,000
Analysis Date: 17 September 2025

Executive Summary
- Focus: Evaluate near-term, capital-efficient expansion for green tea (HS 0902.10; often tracked under HS 0902.10/0902.30) in consumer packs ≤3 kg across Europe and selected high-potential markets.
- Recommendation: Prioritize Germany (DE), France (FR), and Poland (PL) as initial EU entry nodes, with light-touch testing in the Netherlands (NL) for eCommerce cross-border fulfillment. These markets combine high import volumes, growing specialty/health segments, and manageable regulatory complexity under EU harmonization.
- Go-to-Market: Lean digital-first entry (Amazon/OTTO/Cdiscount/Allegro), specialty retail distributors, and ethnic trade wholesalers; position around quality, origin transparency, and wellness; avoid price wars with commoditized mainstream brands.
- Budget: Allocate 40,000 toward regulatory readiness, listings, performance advertising, content/localization, and trade sampling. Target test SOM first 12 months: 0.01–0.03% in top-three markets (Estimate).

Key data integrity note
- This report relies on official trade and market sources. Where precise HS split by pack size is unavailable or paywalled, figures are provided at the closest available HS level and labeled. All estimates are clearly marked.

Market Analysis
Definition and HS Scope
- Product scope: Green tea (not fermented) in immediate packings not exceeding 3 kg; HS 0902.10 in HS1996/2002; in newer HS revisions consumer pack green tea is often 0902.10 (green tea, in immediate packings ≤3 kg) and 0902.20 (>3 kg). Some databases aggregate under 0902.10 (green tea) with pack-size splits not consistently published. We use the narrowest verifiable references and indicate assumptions.

Demand Signals and Trade Flows (2019–2024/2025)
- EU-27 and UK remain major importers of tea; green tea share is materially growing due to health/wellness trends.
- Verified references:
  - WTO/ITC Trade Map (using UN Comtrade) – tea imports by HS 0902 (access requires registration; aggregated numbers publicly referenced) [ITC Trade Map, accessed 2024–2025].
  - Eurostat Comext – extra-EU and intra-EU trade in HS 0902; pack-size splits may be limited (Eurostat Comext, 2023–2024).
  - Statista reports on tea consumption by country; exact figures behind paywall; non-paywalled snapshots indicate growth in green tea segments (Statista, 2023–2024).
  - UK DEFRA/ONS trade for HS 0902 indicates substantial tea imports post-Brexit (UK ONS Trade, 2023–2024).
- Because publicly accessible, disaggregated “≤3kg pack” data is sparse without subscriptions, TAM/SAM estimates below are transparently derived using triangulation and explicitly labeled as estimates.

Consumer Behavior and Purchasing
- Health-driven: Green tea associated with wellness, antioxidants, weight management; premiumization in organic, single-origin, and specialty formats (loose leaf, pyramid sachets). [OECD health trend summaries; general market commentary].
- Channels: Online marketplaces (Amazon DE/FR, Cdiscount FR, Allegro PL), specialty grocers (BIO stores), Asian/ethnic supermarkets, and mainstream supermarkets for larger brands. Online penetration for tea is higher than average pantry categories in DE/FR per eCommerce reports (Estimate based on sector trends; specific percentages not cited due to paywalls).
- Willingness to pay: Premium green tea (100–200g) typically retails at €4–€12 depending on origin/organic; ceremonial matcha significantly higher. Pricing benchmarks should be set by competitive scan per market (see Competitive Landscape).

Regulatory and Compliance
- EU food law harmonization:
  - General Food Law: Regulation (EC) No 178/2002.
  - Food Information to Consumers (FIC): Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 – mandatory language-country labeling, allergens (not typical for pure tea), net quantity, best-before, operator name and address, country of origin where omission misleads.
  - Contaminants: Commission Regulation (EC) No 1881/2006 and updates – sets maximum levels for contaminants.
  - Pesticide residues: Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 – MRLs for tea leaves.
  - Organic (if applicable): Regulation (EU) 2018/848 and control body certification.
  - Materials in contact with food: Framework Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004.
  - Import: RASFF monitoring and possible border checks; CN codes under HS 0902 apply. EORI required for import into EU.
- Country specifics:
  - Germany: LFGB alignment with EU; German language labeling mandatory.
  - France: French language labeling; DGCCRF enforcement.
  - Poland: Polish labeling; Sanitary Inspectorate oversight.
- Non-EU examples (not prioritized in initial wave): UK follows retained EU law; specific labeling differences apply (UK FIC).

Target Market Identification and Sizing
Methodology and Assumptions (Estimate)
- TAM: Retail value for green tea consumer packs ≤3 kg in the selected market.
  - Approach: Use total tea retail value, apply green tea share (public non-paywalled estimates sparse; assume 20–35% in Western EU; 10–20% in CEE based on category mix; clearly labeled as Estimate).
- SAM: Portion of TAM accessible via targeted channels (online marketplaces, specialty/organic, ethnic retail), assumed at 25–40% of TAM initially (Estimate).
- SOM (Year 1): Share capture assumption for a new entrant with 40,000 budget via lean digital-first and distributor model; assumed 0.01–0.03% of TAM (Estimate) depending on market competitiveness and listing success.

- Traceability and QR-linked origin stories.
- Low-caffeine/decaf green variants and functional blends.
- Sustainable packaging (plastic-free, compostable sachets) aligned with EU packaging directives and SUP restrictions.

Strategic Recommendations
Market Entry Phasing
- Phase 1 (Months 1–6): Germany, France, Poland via marketplaces; Netherlands for EU fulfillment.
- Phase 2 (Months 6–12): Add selective specialty retail distributors; test UK only after EU traction due to customs complexity.

Value Proposition
- “Clean and transparent green tea,” origin-forward, low residue with published COAs, sustainable packaging, and credible certifications (organic where supply secured).

Route-to-Market
- Centralized EU fulfillment (Netherlands or Germany) to enable fast shipping to DE/FR/PL.
- Appoint local compliance/labeling agency; translate SKUs to DE/FR/PL.
- Secure one national specialty distributor per market with no exclusivity until volumes proven.

Performance Goals (Estimate)
- Year-1 revenue target across DE/FR/PL: €90k–€250k feasible range with successful listings and advertising efficiency; aligns with SOM table ranges.
